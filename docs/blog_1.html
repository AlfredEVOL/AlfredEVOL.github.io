<h2 id="thoughts-on-life">&gt; Thoughts on life</h2>
<p>People believe we have a destiny, a goal we should strive for, something God planned for us. A bit to self-centered in my opinion. People feeling they are more than just a speck of dust does not make sense. The purpose of life is meaningless. Have fun while your alive. Once you run out, its over. The END. Seems rather depressing , but if you actually think about it, its freeing. You donâ€™t have a massive destiny to fulfill on your shoulders. Your free to do what you love , what makes you happy and then die with a smile on your face.</p>
<p>Okay, this is getting to boring. I am sleepy and i think i should add a table in the main page for these posts or blogs or whatever u might call it.</p>
