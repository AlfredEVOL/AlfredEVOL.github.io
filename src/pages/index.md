```sh
$ Hello World!
```
> too clichÃ© right! lol

I am alfred jophy , just a random guy doing random stuff. Mostly 'cause i am bored and got nothing else to do
and also because somethings have literally got me *hooked*. I like making stuff , breaking stuff (happens a lot tbh) 
and then losing my mind fixing everything i broke beause i was too lazy to read the manual.

### > What I love...
>Free and Open Source Software (**FOSS**) , absolutely love linux (*btw, i use arch*) , privacy is a necessity and of course food.

### > What I hate...
Google , Apple , Microsoft , Adobe , **FACEBOOK** (*AHHHHHH!!!*) and every other proprietary , greedy , capitalist , data stealing , mind numbing companies, enterprises and ventures 

### > So , why am i doing this??
>well , i wanted website and made a simple one with _html and css_ and i lost my mind when i had to spends a few hours to center a freaking image.
So , i looked for something better - minimal , easy and fast. And i found _Markdown , [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [terminal.css](https://terminalcss.xyz/)_ and fell in love.<br/>
