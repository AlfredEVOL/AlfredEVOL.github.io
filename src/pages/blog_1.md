## >  Thoughts on life

People believe we have a destiny, a goal we should strive for, something God planned for us. A bit to self-centered in my opinion. People feeling they are more
than just a speck of dust does not make sense. The purpose of life is meaningless. Have fun while your alive. Once you run out, its over. The END.
Seems rather depressing , but if you actually think about it, its freeing. You don't have a massive destiny to fulfill on your shoulders. Your free to do what you love
, what makes you happy and then die with a smile on your face. 

Okay, this is getting to boring. I am sleepy and i think i should add a table in the main page for these posts or blogs or whatever u might call it.
